# ChildSafetyMonitoringApp
This project consists of a mobile application to monitor child safety while cycling using the phone's GPS sensor, accelerometer and orientation sensor. There is also a provision of a free real time call using the local network. This app was made as an assignment in the Signal Systems and Random Processes course at IITGN.
